Working with the OBudget2 project :

1. Fork the project from git@github.com:yossale/OBudget_II.git
2. Open the project via eclipse 
3. You're probably missing the 3rdParty dependency of the smartGwt. You can download it from here : http://code.google.com/p/smartgwt/downloads/detail?name=smartgwt-2.4.zip&can=2&q=
4. add the dependency to the project , and see all the red lines compiled :) 
5. Compile the project for the first time by clicking on the gwt red tool box. 
6. You can now run the project :)
